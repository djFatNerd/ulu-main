# Open sample datasets

The files in this directory are illustrative, freely redistributable samples
that demonstrate how to run the multisource enrichment workflow without paid
APIs:

- `community_pois.geojson` – a GeoJSON FeatureCollection with cultural and
  civic amenities derived from open data catalog examples.
- `business_registry.csv` – a synthetic registry excerpt showing how CSV-based
  metadata can complement OSM tags.

Replace these files with your own open datasets (for example, Microsoft building
footprints, Mapillary exports, or municipal open data portals) to tailor the
pipeline to your area of interest.
